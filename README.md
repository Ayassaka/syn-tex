# [SynTex](https://ayassaka.github.io/syn-tex/)

An interactive TeX equation editor with selection mapping.

## TODO

- Finish readme.
- Backward selection should map to closed braces and environments.
- Handle `\left` and `\right`.
- Add Resizable Editor.
- Avoid preview overflow.
- Fix dragging without triggering backward selection.
